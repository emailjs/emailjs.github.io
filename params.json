{"name":"email.js","tagline":"A toolbox for writing Email client and server applications in JavaScript.","body":"### What is it?\r\nEmail.js is a set of components for email that can be used to write email apps in pure JavaScript on the client in html5 applications or on the server in node.js. They can be used together or separately depending on what you need:\r\n\r\n1. an IMAP client: [browserbox](https://github.com/whiteout-io/browserbox)\r\n2. an SMTP client: [smtpclient](https://github.com/whiteout-io/smtpclient)\r\n3. an email parser: [mimeparser](https://github.com/whiteout-io/mimeparser)\r\n4. an email builder: [mailbuild](https://github.com/whiteout-io/mailbuild)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Open Source (MIT license)\r\n* Well tested for client and server\r\n* Standards based (uses [Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays), [Raw Sockets](http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/tcp-udp-sockets/), and the [TextEncoder](http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/) api)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nIn order to communicate over tcp the IMAP and SMTP components require apis that are currently only supported natively by Firefox OS. For platforms like [Chrome Apps](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) that don't natively support theses apis yet, the following shims are used behind the scenes:\r\n\r\n* [tcp-socket](https://github.com/whiteout-io/tcp-socket)\r\n* [stringencoding](https://github.com/whiteout-io/stringencoding)\r\n\r\n### Support & Mailing List\r\n\r\nIf you need help getting started or would like to contribute, please checkout our mailing list:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/emailjs\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe components were originally written by Andris Reinman (@andris9), the author of [Nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/). They are also maintained by Felix Hammerl (@felixhammerl) and used in production by [Whiteout Mail](https://whiteout.io/). [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) is also planning to use them in their [Firefox OS mail client](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia-email-libs-and-more).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
